#Project 2 – CIFAR10 Clustering

Use a subset of only 3 classes from CIFAR10 (32x32 RGB images) <br>
Explore the database using unsupervised tools <br>
Try to cluster into 3 different clusters<br>
There is ground truth, but don’t use it for the fit, only for the evaluation and data exploration! (e.g. you can use rand index)<br>
No need to split into Train & Test<br>

The delivery should be a notebook consist of code, saved results and explanations<br>
Delivery should be till lecture #18<br>
It’s a research project without a quantitative goal (the clustering does not necessary correspond to the ground truth). A recommended research question is: 
According to which features does the clustering algorithms you will use split the space ?<br>
We expect to see:<br>
Data exploration<br>
At least three different attitudes of clustering<br>
Usage of metrics for evaluation<br>
Comments and explanations for each step you did<br>
Summaries what you learn from the project<br>
Extra (for fit walkers only)<br>
